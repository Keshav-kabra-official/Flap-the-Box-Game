> This is game written with PyGame in Python.
> A box is shown on the screen, you have to save it from the pipes moving in direction of this box.

> Controls :
	--> Space_Key or Up-Arrow_Key to flap the box upwards.
	--> P to pause the game.
	--> If not flapping, box will move downwards.

> The player will be out if box either touches pipes, up-end or bottom-end of the screen. Your score will be		displayed on the same screen.

> After completion of each 10 points :
	--> A message showing 'level-up' will be displayed on screen and game will be paused for 0.7 second.
	--> The background of game will be changed.
	--> The space between pipes will be decreased and speen of motion of pipes will be increased.

> After completion of each 30 points :
	--> You will be considered to cross a 'major-level'.
	--> The gaps between pipes and their speed will be increased to greater extent as compared to each 10 points.

> Since the screen is stopped for 0.7s after completion of each level, the pipe speed for the
    first point after a level-up will be much slower -- so that player again gets tuned.

> Interactive sounds have been provided for flapping of box, each point scored, crossing 'level' or	'major-level' and hitting of box.
